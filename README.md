# PostBlog

A blog post app with post/update/delete functionalities. This app was made to know more about creating apps using ExpressJS and for templating using EmbeddedJS.

The goal for me is not to create a fully fledged blog application it's mainly for me to test out how i can implement post/update/delete functionalities. So any user can create blog and any one can edit anyone's blog since, for db i am only using .json as the db implemenation for this won't be much difficult, therefore to save time i am taking this approach.

## Features

1. Post Creation: Users should be able to create new posts.

2. Post Viewing: The home page should allow the user to view all their posts.

3. Post Update/Delete: Users should be edit and delete posts as needed.

3. Styling: The application should be well-styled and responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

1. **Node.js and Express.js:** The app is a web server built using Node.js and Express.js. Express.js will handle the routing and middlewares.

2. **EJS:** It uses EJS as templating engine to generate dynamic HTML based on the application's state.
